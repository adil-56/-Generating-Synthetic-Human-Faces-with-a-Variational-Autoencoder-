# Generating Synthetic Human Faces with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

## 1. Overview

This project explores the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a type of generative deep learning model, to create novel, realistic human faces. The model learns a compressed, latent representation of facial features from a large dataset of celebrity images and then samples from this learned distribution to generate new, synthetic images.

## 2. Problem Statement

Generative models have wide-ranging applications in art, design, data augmentation, and entertainment. Creating realistic human faces from scratch is a classic benchmark for a model's generative capability. This project aims to build and train a VAE that can understand the high-level features of a human face and generate plausible new examples that do not exist in the original dataset.

## 3. Dataset

The model was trained on the **CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset**.

* **Source:** [CelebA Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)
* **Content:** A large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. For this project, only the images themselves were used.
* **Preprocessing:** Images were cropped to focus on the face and resized to a standard 64x64 or 128x128 resolution.

## 4. Methodology

#### a. Model Architecture: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
A VAE consists of two main components: an **Encoder** and a **Decoder**.

* **Encoder:** This is a neural network that takes an input image and maps it to a latent space. Instead of outputting a single point, it outputs the parameters (mean and log-variance) of a Gaussian probability distribution. This probabilistic encoding is what allows for smooth generation.
* **Decoder:** This network takes a point sampled from the latent distribution (produced by the encoder) and attempts to reconstruct the original input image from it.

#### b. Training Process
The model is trained to optimize a unique loss function composed of two parts:
1.  **Reconstruction Loss:** This measures how well the decoder is able to reconstruct the input image (e.g., using Mean Squared Error or Binary Cross-Entropy). It forces the model to learn effective compression.
2.  **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence:** This term acts as a regularizer. It measures how much the learned latent distribution deviates from a standard normal distribution (mean=0, variance=1). This encourages the latent space to be well-structured and continuous, which is crucial for generating good new samples.

## 5. Hypothetical Results

After training, the decoder can be used as a standalone generator. By feeding it random vectors sampled from the standard normal distribution, it can produce an infinite number of new, unique faces. The quality of the generated faces would be assessed visually.

*(A good result would be a grid of generated faces that are coherent, diverse, and realistic, even if slightly blurry, which is common for VAEs.)*
